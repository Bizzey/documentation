# Introduction

The Bizzey API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable, resource-oriented URLs and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs which are understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients. We support cross-origin resource sharing [cross-origin resource sharing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing), allowing you to interact securely with our API from a client-side web application. [JSON](http://www.json.org/) is returned by all API responses, including errors.

**The requests in the right sidebar are designed to work as is.** The sample requests are performed using an API key, linked to your account under the account section inside Bizzey. Only you can see this account-specific value.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Authenticate your account by including your secret key in API requests. You can manage your API keys in the [Account section](https://www.bizzey.be/account) Your API keys carry many privileges, so keep them secure at all times! Do not share you secret API key in publicly accesible areas such as repositories, client-side code and so on.

Authentication to the API is performed via [HTTP basic Auth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)

All API requests must be mode over [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure).
Calls made over plain HTTP and without authentication will fail.

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
