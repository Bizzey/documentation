# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```javascript
fetch('API_ENDPOINT', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'API_KEY'
  }
})
```

> Make sure to replace `API_KEY` with your API key.

Authenticate your account by including your secret key in API requests. You can manage your API keys in the [Account section](https://www.bizzey.be/account). Your API keys carry many privileges, so keep them secure at all times! Do not share you secret API key in publicly accesible areas such as repositories, client-side code and so on.

Authentication to the API is performed via [HTTP basic Auth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)

All API requests must be made over [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure).
Calls made over plain HTTP and without authentication will fail.
